📘 Title: Automated Scheme Research Tool
Candidate: Naman Anand
Company: Haqdarshak
Stack: Streamlit · LangChain · FAISS · HuggingFace · OpenAI · Python

🧠 Objective
The goal of this project is to automate the research and summarization of government scheme documents. Users can input URLs (PDFs), receive structured summaries, and ask natural language questions — all backed by vector search and language models.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python Web UI)

LLM: google/flan-t5-base (HuggingFace)

Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Vector DB: FAISS (local)

PDF Parsing: PyMuPDF (via LangChain loader)

QA Engine: LangChain RetrievalQA over FAISS

💡 How it Works
User inputs a PDF URL of a government scheme

PDF is downloaded and parsed using PyMuPDF

Text is split, embedded locally using MiniLM

Stored in FAISS index for fast similarity search

Summary generated using flan-t5-base

User can ask any question and get an answer from the document

❗ Challenges I Faced
OpenAI quota limits: My API key had insufficient quota, and upgrading required billing activation.

OpenAI rate limits and latency: Embedding and chat response times were slow, and usage was costly.

PDFs from government URLs: Could not be loaded directly with UnstructuredURLLoader; required temporary download and local parsing using PyMuPDF.

Model size: Falcon 7B was too large for CPU — processing stalled for 15–20 minutes.

Solution: I switched to flan-t5-base, which runs smoothly on CPU, uses less RAM, and is fast enough for real-time summarization and QA.
